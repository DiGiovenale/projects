#Inter-MySQL

Inter-MySQL is GUI for MySQL.
It consists in a simple interface and could be an easy alternative
to running commands through a shell command-line.

As the Inter-MySQL is launched, the user will be asked for his username and password.
If both of them are correct, a connection with MySQL will be established.
To run a command, simply type it in the first entry-box and press Return.
The result is shown in the scrollbox at the bottom of the window.

To intstall Inter-MySQL simply download the whole directory.
Be sure to have both pymysql and tkinter in your import-path.
By running 'run.py', Inter-MySQL will be launched.

For now the program is working only on Python 3.X.
